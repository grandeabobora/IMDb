# IMDb
Make some cool plots using IMDb data. You will need:

1. bash
2. R
3. ggplot2 and dplyr packages for R
 
I used Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead as examples, but you can use any TV series you want, with minor changes to my code.

If you are on Linux or OS X, you only need to run

1. sh download.sh (in a Terminal window)
2. Open R, copy and paste the code inside analysis.r

That's all!
